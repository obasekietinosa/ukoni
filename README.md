# ukoni
Keep track of and manage grocery shopping on a per item basis

## Introduction
This is a monorepo for Ukoni, holding the backend API and the web app for it.

There will be different languages and different self contained applications. The monorepo is mostly for convenience when working with AI agents. Each app will have its own README which goes into detail on specifics for that app.

At a high level, the backend will be a REST API written in Golang and the frontend will be an SPA written in React with Typescript.

## Folder structure
Each application will have a folder in the root that holds everything about the app e.g ukoni/web for the web app and ukoni/api for the rest api.
